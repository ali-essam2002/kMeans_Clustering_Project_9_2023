## **Code Description**

Our project code encompasses a variety of tasks for data analysis, visualization, and clustering. Below is an overview of the key code snippets and their purposes:

- Import necessary libraries including `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
- Read data from the "College_Data" CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create scatterplots to visualize relationships between variables such as "Room.Board" and "Grad.Rate," distinguishing data points by "Private" category.
- Generate histograms using Seaborn to further explore data distributions, with optional distinctions by "Private" category.
- Identify and handle data anomalies, such as instances where "Grad.Rate" exceeds 100%, and set them to 100 for consistency.
- Implement K-means clustering to group data into clusters based on features from the DataFrame.
- Assess clustering results by mapping cluster labels to meaningful categories like 'No' and 'Yes' for interpretability.
- Calculate confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate the clustering performance.
- Utilize the "Elbow Method" to determine the optimal number of clusters, plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against different values of 'k'
- Provide clear instructions for executing the code and accessing required data.
- Explain the data source and the need for the "College_Data" dataset in the code.
- Emphasize the importance of a properly configured Python environment with the necessary dependencies.

 ## **Requirements**

Ensure that you have a suitable Python environment set up, including the required libraries mentioned earlier. Additionally, have the "College_Data" dataset file available for analysis.

 ## **Usage**

This versatile code can be employed for various data analysis tasks, including data preprocessing, visualization, and clustering. Execute the code following the instructions within the code comments or detailed in accompanying documentation.

## **Data**

For the code to function correctly, you need access to the "College_Data" dataset. Ensure that this dataset is available in the specified format and location, as outlined in the code or documentation.

## **Analysis**

The code covers a wide range of data analysis techniques, from basic data exploration with scatterplots and histograms to advanced clustering using K-means. Detailed explanations of each analysis step are embedded within the code or available in accompanying documentation.

## **Results**

The code generates results in various forms, including visualizations, metrics, and cluster labels. These results offer valuable insights into the analyzed data and can be viewed in the code output or detailed in accompanying documentation.
